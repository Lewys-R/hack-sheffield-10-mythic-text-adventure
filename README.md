# How to Run Mythic

To run your app locally, you must have Node.js installed.
This may be done for you prior to compile time.
After confirming Node.js is installed, then run:

1. 'npm install' or 'npm i' for short.
2. Then create a file in the root directory '/hack-sheffield-10-...' called '.env.local'.
3. Generate a Google Gemini API key in Google AI Studio.
4. Add to the '.env.local' file: 'GEMINI_API_KEY=[YOUR API KEY]'.
7. Finally, run the programme with `npm run dev`.
